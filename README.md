# ✨ Flandre's README ✨

Hehe, so you found me\~ This is my very own Discord Bot, don’t underestimate it!
Inside, I’ve hidden some little toys and commands… Wanna play with me? (*giggle*)

## 📂 Project Structure

This is my little room, everything’s neatly arranged, so don’t mess it up, okay?

```
index.js        - The entrance! Open this door and you’ll see me (main login thread)  
commands/       - My toy box, filled with all sorts of commands  
 └── *.js       - 11 commands, not counting the ones only my master can use  
events/         - The place where I secretly watch everything you do (event listeners)  
 └── clientReady.js - The moment I wake up, this kicks in~  
```
